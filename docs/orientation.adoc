== Orientation sensor

The app listens to the platform game rotation vector sensor and converts each
sample into a quaternion using `SensorManager.getQuaternionFromVector`. The
game variant avoids magnetometer corrections, which prevents sudden heading
jumps when the field measurement is disturbed. If the game sensor is
unavailable the implementation falls back to the standard rotation vector
sensor. The fused orientation complements the gyroscope integration by
providing an absolute heading, which can be toggled in the settings under
*Orientation sensor*. When the orientation sensor is active its heading is
applied instead of the gyroscope estimate so the plot reflects a single,
consistent device rotation.

All quaternions collected between LiDAR rotations are buffered and recorded in
session files. During playback the last quaternion for each rotation is applied
so that the LiDAR plot matches the recorded device pose.
