== Orientation sensor

The app listens to the platform game rotation vector sensor when available,
falling back to the full rotation vector on older devices. Each sample is
converted into a quaternion using `SensorManager.getQuaternionFromVector`. The
game rotation vector ignores the magnetometer so the heading remains smooth when
the magnetic field changes, while the fallback preserves compatibility. The
fused orientation complements the gyroscope integration by providing an
absolute heading, which can be toggled in the settings under *Orientation
sensor*.

All quaternions collected between LiDAR rotations are buffered and recorded in
session files. During playback the last quaternion for each rotation is applied
so that the LiDAR plot matches the recorded device pose.
