== Replay mode

Use the *Load* button to select a previously saved recording. Gzip-compressed session files and legacy JSON recordings are supported. Once loaded, playback controls appear below the plot allowing you to play, pause and seek through the data. Buttons adjust speed or step forward and backward by one rotation at a time.

Press *Exit Replay* to return to live mode. Recording or loading another file is disabled while replay is active.

Playback statistics like rotations per second are derived from the timestamps in
the recording rather than the system clock, so measurement rates match the
original session even when playing faster or slower than real time.
