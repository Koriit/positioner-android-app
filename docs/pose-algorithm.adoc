== Pose algorithm

Choose between different pose estimation strategies. The default **Occupancy grid** performs a brute-force search, while the **Particle filter** uses sequential importance sampling with low-variance resampling to explore pose space probabilistically. The particle filter can converge faster on large maps but may deliver approximate results compared to the exhaustive search.
