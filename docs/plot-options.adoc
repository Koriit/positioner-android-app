== Plot display options

The main screen provides a few controls to adjust how lidar measurements are rendered.

* **Rotate 90\u00B0** - rotates the coordinate system clockwise by ninety degrees. Use this when the sensor orientation doesn't match the default plot.
The **Auto scale** option is available from the settings screen. It automatically scales the plot so that all current measurements fit inside the canvas.
