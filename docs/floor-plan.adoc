== Floor plan overlay

You can load one or more GeoJSON files describing your building layout.
Each `LineString` or `Polygon` ring is drawn in blue on top of the LiDAR plot.
When *Auto scale* is enabled the canvas size now also accounts for the loaded
floor plan so the outline remains visible even before any LiDAR points appear.
This helps orient measurements relative to real walls.

The first loaded polygon is also used to estimate the sensor orientation, scale
and the user's position. Measurements are rotated to match the detected
orientation while the floor plan remains fixed. As new points arrive the red dot
moves around the map to reflect the estimated location of the device.
