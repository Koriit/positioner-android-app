== Floor plan overlay

You can load one or more GeoJSON files describing your building layout.
Each `LineString` or `Polygon` ring is drawn in blue on top of the LiDAR plot.
When *Auto scale* is enabled the canvas size now also accounts for the loaded
floor plan so the outline remains visible even before any LiDAR points appear.
This helps orient measurements relative to real walls.
