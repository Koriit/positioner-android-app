== Gyroscope integration

The app samples the device gyroscope to improve pose estimation. Measurements are
recorded asynchronously at a configurable rate (default 200 Hz, minimum 100 Hz).
The rate can be adjusted in the settings screen. Sampling above 200 Hz requires
the `HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS` permission which is declared in the manifest.

All samples collected between two LiDAR rotations are buffered and stored with
each rotation packet. If the gyroscope is unavailable, disabled or either
required permission is missing the app continues without IMU data.

When the *Rotate measurements* option is enabled in the gyroscope section of
the settings screen the app integrates the z-axis angular velocity to estimate
device heading and rotates the LiDAR scan before rendering it. Negative sensor
values correspond to turning right, so the plot is rotated to the right to keep
the environment aligned with the real world orientation.
