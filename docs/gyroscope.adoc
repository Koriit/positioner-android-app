== Gyroscope integration

The app samples the device gyroscope to improve pose estimation. Measurements are
recorded asynchronously at a configurable rate (default 200 Hz, minimum 100 Hz).
The rate can be adjusted in the settings screen. Sampling above 200 Hz requires
the `HIGH_SAMPLING_RATE_SENSORS` permission which is declared in the manifest.

All samples collected between two LiDAR rotations are buffered and stored with
each rotation packet. If the gyroscope is unavailable, disabled or either
required permission is missing the app continues without IMU data.
