 = Occupancy Structure

The pose estimator uses a quadtree built from the floor-plan polygon.

Each node covers a square region. Regions fully inside or outside the plan are
stored as terminal nodes. Mixed regions are recursively subdivided until the
desired cell size is reached. This hierarchical representation drastically
reduces memory usage and enables fast point-in-polygon checks compared to a
dense grid.
