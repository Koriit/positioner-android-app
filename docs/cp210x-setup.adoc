== Using CP210x USB Serial

To connect the YDLIDAR through a CP210x UART-USB bridge you need to enable a few phone features:

. **USB OTG / Host mode** - Make sure your phone supports USB host mode and that the OTG option is enabled in system settings.
. **USB permission** - When the device is first plugged in, Android will prompt to allow the app access to the USB device. Accept this request so the app can open the serial port.
. (Optional) **Developer options** -> *USB debugging* can help when inspecting connection issues.

After granting permission the app will automatically open the CP210x port and start plotting measurements.

NOTE: USB host mode is not supported in the Android emulator. You must use a physical device to communicate with the CP210x bridge.
