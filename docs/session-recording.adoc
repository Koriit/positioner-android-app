== Session recording

Recordings are saved as gzip-compressed NDJSON files. Each line contains a JSON
object describing a single LiDAR rotation with its measurements, buffered
gyroscope readings and start timestamp. The format is easily extendable so
future attributes can be added without breaking compatibility.

Older recordings stored as a plain JSON array of measurements are still
supported and are automatically converted when loaded.
