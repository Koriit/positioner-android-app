== Isolation distance filter

The isolation distance slider removes stray points that have no neighbours within the specified radius.
The distance is measured in metres. The default value is 0.75m.
Points must have at least two neighbours within this radius to remain visible.
This filter is applied after measurements are read so recordings keep every data point.
