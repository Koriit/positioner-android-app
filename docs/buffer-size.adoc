== Measurement buffer size

The settings panel includes a slider that controls how many lidar data points are kept in memory and displayed on the plot.
Increasing the value shows more history but uses more memory. The default is 480 points.

Enabling *Match buffer to rotation* adjusts the buffer size and flush interval automatically so each flush contains one full LiDAR rotation. Data is emitted whenever the angle resets.
